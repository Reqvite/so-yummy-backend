# Back-end part of So Yummy Project

## About
The back-end part of the So Yummy project is responsible for handling server-side logic, data storage, and communication between the front-end and the database. It includes a database that stores all recipe information, and user data.

The back-end part of the project is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provide a robust and flexible framework for building web applications. The database management system used in this project is MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.

API endpoints are defined in the server-side code and handle incoming requests from the front-end. The back-end also includes middleware for user authentication and authorization, which ensures that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform certain actions.

To help with documentation and testing of the API, the So Yummy project utilizes Swagger, a tool that generates a user interface based on the OpenAPI specification. The Swagger UI allows developers to visualize and interact with the API's endpoints, making it easier to test and debug.
